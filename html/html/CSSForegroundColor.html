        <h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
        <p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials <br />
           from Earth's crust as well as materials released from organisms. The most important <br />
           components of seawater that influence life forms are salinity, temperature, <br />
           dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and pH. These <br />
           elements vary in their composition as well as in their influence on marine life.</p>
